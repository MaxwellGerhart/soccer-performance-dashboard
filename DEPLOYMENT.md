# NCAA Soccer Dashboard - Render Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Files Created for Deployment:
- [x] `start.py` - Application entry point for Render
- [x] `render.yaml` - Render configuration file
- [x] Updated `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` to include data but exclude sensitive files
- [x] Updated `ncaa_app.py` to create static directories

### 📋 Next Steps:

#### 1. Commit and Push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Deploy on Render:
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub account and select this repository
4. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: `ncaa-soccer-dashboard`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python start.py`
   - **Instance Type**: Free (for testing) or Starter (for production)

#### 3. Environment Variables (Optional):
In Render dashboard, you can set:
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: `3.11.0`
- `PORT`: (automatically set by Render)

#### 4. Your App Will Be Available At:
`https://ncaa-soccer-dashboard-[random].onrender.com`

### 🔧 What's Been Configured:

#### Production-Ready Features:
- ✅ **Host Binding**: App runs on `0.0.0.0` (required for Render)
- ✅ **Port Configuration**: Uses environment PORT variable
- ✅ **Static Files**: Radar chart directory created automatically
- ✅ **Database**: SQLite database included in deployment
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All required packages in requirements.txt

#### App Features That Will Work:
- ✅ Home page with statistics
- ✅ Player listings with search and pagination
- ✅ Team standings with MAX/ATT/DEF ratings
- ✅ Player profiles with radar charts
- ✅ Team profiles with rosters and match history
- ✅ All team logos and static assets

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

#### Free Tier Limitations:
- App sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Cold starts take 30-60 seconds
- 512MB RAM limit (sufficient for your app)
- 750 hours/month (more than enough)

#### Performance Tips:
- First radar chart generation may be slow (cold start)
- Subsequent charts will be faster
- Consider upgrading to Starter plan ($7/month) for better performance

### 🐛 Troubleshooting:

If deployment fails, check:
1. All files are committed and pushed to GitHub
2. `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
3. `start.py` is in the root directory
4. Database file (`data/ncaa_soccer.db`) is included in repository

### 📊 Expected Performance:
- **Page Load Times**: 1-3 seconds (after cold start)
- **Radar Chart Generation**: 2-5 seconds per chart
- **Database Queries**: <500ms (SQLite is fast for your data size)
- **Concurrent Users**: 10-50 users should work fine on free tier

Ready to deploy! 🎉
